# DiceGame
Here is my test assignment for Mindgame b.v.
Playable build: http://18964.hosts.ma-cloud.nl/bewijzenmap/3deJaar/DiceGame/

The rules are:

You have two dices and 5 lives.
Roll them and if they have the same number of eyes, you get a life up.
If not, then you lose a life.

Continue as long as possible until you don't have any lives left.
Your score is the amount of turns you rolled.

The dices and cup are animated with CSS keyframes.
Game programmed in Javascript.
